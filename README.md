# Projects
Hi there,
This is a personal repository made not for live/ongoing projects but to be used to project my experience of different computer languages. This repository covers my projects done in the past some of these were done in a team while most of them were done alone to meet project requirement. Feedback on these projects maybe the most relevant piece of information that may interest you, however, please feel free to review code as well. You are welcome to contact me at anytime on details on my website.

Enjoy the code!

Thanks.
