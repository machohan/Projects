# Projects
Hi there,
This is a personal repository made not for live/ongoing projects but to be used to project my experience of different computer languages. This repository covers my projects done in the past some of these were done in a team while most of them were done alone to meet project requirement. The control version that was decided to use was SVN and hence this repository contains copies for those projects. Since SVN repositories were made private, I am unable to share my projects directly through SVN and hence decide to make my projects public through github. However, those projects that I contributed to and used git as source control can be accessed [here](https://github.com/machohan) under "Repositories contributed to" section. Feedback on these projects maybe the most relevant piece of information that may interest you, however, please feel free to review code as well. You are welcome to contact me at anytime on details on my website.
