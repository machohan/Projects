//Sprint 5 Backlog.  
November 02 to November 05

Product Backlog items to be implemented:
a) Implement tests for all Commands (carryover from A2A)
b) Implement feature to make success output of command to be saved in a file.
c) Implement feature to recursively list all components of a cwd or path that resolves to a directory.
d) Implement feature to get contents from given URL and save in a file.

Specific tasks to be accomplished:
a-1. Tests for CommandCat: testGetName (or remove test); more tests
a-2. Tests for CommandCd: more tests
a-3. Tests for CommandCp. WRITE ALL TESTS.
a-4. Tests for CommandEcho. Test doesn't need directory structure setup.
a-5. Tests for CommandLs. More test cases, including recursion.
a-6. Tests for CommandMkdir. WRITE ALL TESTS.
a-7. Tests for CommandMv. Test that directory actually moved, etc. 
a-8. Tests for CommandRm. Make sure both the recursive and non-recursive versions work
a-9. Tests for CommandGet. Test parsing, retrieval of known URL, etc.
b-1. Modify Interpreter to identify and syntax-check redirection (use Token?)
b-2. Modify Interpreter to open files, check errors, write output.
b-3. Remove redirection from Echo command.
c-1. add option-parsing to ls
c-2. add recursion to ls
d-1. Create Get Command
d-2. Get command retrieves URL
d-3. Get command writes URL contents to correctly-named file.
e-1. Create pushd DIR command
