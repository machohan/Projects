What did I do last time?
  Massive refactor of package namespace, much fighting with Eclipse
  Added Error and Success, subclasses of Result
  Sketched out CommandGrep (task c, partially completed)
  re-wrote failing tests for CommandMan (task d)

What do I plan to do now?
  Continued work on CommandGrep
  Plan refactor of Error reporting to allow stderr/stdout streams
  Plan possible refactor of tokenization

Am I blocked on anything?
  Tokenization question: Abbas
