What did I do last time?
  Signed up for Sprint6 tasks.
  Completed Sprint6 tasks:
  --(a-2, b-2) provided a stack in the JShell class
  --(c-2) wrote code to remove a given file/dir (in FileSystem & Path)
  Nightly JUnit runs to annoy (I mean, help) team-mates.

What do I plan to do now?
  Write some more tests, support team-mates
  Investigate automated JUnit run/summary.

Am I blocked on anything?
  Not currently blocked.
