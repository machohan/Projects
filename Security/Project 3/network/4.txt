Analysis:
Dell appears to be used as the host for the print server, to which black and white printers Canon-iP4200 and Canon-MF4100 
are connected. Cisco-Li acts as the hosting system for SSDP as well as HTTP, and hosts the domain www.cs.toronto.edu.
CadmusCo is the user system used to access the HTTP server and perform the request for the page at /~arnold/346/
assignments/03/special. Cisco-Li most likely uses an ARP table that clears periodically, as it asks for the MAC
address at 192.168.1.130 in the middle of communication. The server Cisco-Li uses TCP protocol to establish
connections, and uses Basic Authentication to verify user credentials. 
	

b) Riddle: Whats the question? Whats the answer?

Question: What's Fast?
Answer: smokin' tuna

c) Describe how you solved the above questions and two different ways one could prevent such an attack.

Only Basic Authentication was used in the HTTP protocol, allowing me to easily view the user credentials that were
translated via WireShark. After obtaining the credentials, I simply accessed the page through a browser and entered 
the credentials, gaining proper access. This could similarly be accomplished by a man in the middle attack.

One way to prevent such an attack is to use encryption via HTTPS protocol instead of HTTP. This would ensure the privacy
and integrity of the exchanged data, such that ARP spoofing or sniffing would be much less likely. Another way of 
preventing such an attack would be to use static ARP entries. This would ensure that hackers cannot use ARP spoofing on
your network, as MAC addresses will not be changed once set. This would help prevent man in the middle attacks from
intercepting user credentials and other crucial data.

d) List anything else you discovered. Be creative.

There is an interesting interaction between CadmusCo, Cisco-Li, and IntelCor. CadmusCo sends requests to Cisco-Li while
Cisco-Li sends replies to IntelCor. According to the traffic, both CadmusCo and IntelCor appear to be sharing the same
IP Address at 192.168.1.130, despite the two having different MAC addresses. One possible explanation for this could be
that IntelCor is acting as a man in the middle between CadmusCo and Cisco-Li. This would allow IntelCor to intercept all
data exchanges between the two, and possibly obtain crucial data, such as the user credentials in this case.
