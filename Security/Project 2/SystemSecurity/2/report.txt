Our approach:
-bypass BIOS by deleting nvram - BIOS is no more password protected.
-change boot order to be booted from CD-ROM first.
-Insert Ubuntu Server CD and boot from it.
-Follow steps on screen to launch a shell with root privileges.
-using adduser command, create another user.
-using chmod, change permission on shadow and passwd files to 777.
-boot up machine as normal. Login using newly added user.
-using scp to copy required files from VM using its IP.
-Alternatively,ftp software could also be used to copy files.

To prevent:
-It should be a policy that no one except administrator or authorised employees should have physical access to machine and it should be placed in a locked and secured place.
-Disable acceptance of all medium on machine by physically customising the machine (i.e must not have cdrom).
-BIOS must be protected with strong password.
-BIOS should be modify to disable booting from any medium except only one from where it is secured to be booted.
